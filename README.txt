--- About This Repo ---
-----------------------
This repository is a 2D Game Engine built with the Allegro c++ library.

It is meant to be a starting platform to build and customize 2D games.

The engine uses Allegro to run through the game loop at a constant 60 fps
  regardless of how powerful the machine is as long as it has decent hardware.

The engine is ready to extend by adding classes to manage sprites and render
  them on the screen.

--------------------------
--- Build Instructions ---
--------------------------
This project was originally built and ran within Visual Studio.

You can install Allegro using Visual Studio's built in Nuget Package Manager.

Alternatively you can install Allegro manually and link the library with
  the project to build it.

------------------------
--- Run Instructions ---
------------------------
To run this project, simply run the executable created by compiling.

While running you should see a black screen, but if you press f1, statistics
  for the engine's running status should appear on screen to ensure everything
  is working properly.
